# CONQUERING RESPONSIVE LAYOUT(by Kevin Powell)

I'm taking a course on Responsive Layout by Kevin, and I am so excited about it!

## DAY 1

- Learned about how using percentages for width and other related stuff helps in making a webpage resonsive (Although I have been using percentages since I can remember)
