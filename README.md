# CONQUERING RESPONSIVE LAYOUT(by Kevin Powell)

I'm taking a course on Responsive Layout by Kevin, and I am so excited about it!

## DAY 1

- Learned about how using percentages for width and other related stuff helps in making a webpage resonsive (Although I have been using percentages since I can remember)
- Got a better understanding of responsive layouts. Understood that a webpage is awesomely responsive by default, but it's me who in a bid to style it, disrupts a lot of things
- Learnt about the all powerful 'em's and 'rem's ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) uses them a lot and I've been so curious to find out why, now I know

## DAY 2

Day 2 was quite less engaging and more of a reiteration of what was already learnt about 'em's and 'rem's, but this time in a more enlightening way. Hope to get my hands on and testing out what was learnt. Will update here soon.

- I was able to use the 'em' to create a little demo page, in which if I changed the value of the 'font-size' property in the 'body' element, every other element on the page would scale relatively(in response to the body). Checkout the demo [here](https://codepen.io/emekaorji/pen/JjJPRLY)

## Day 3

- Learned to use the 'max-width' property
- The 'max-width' property would help in making your webpage responsive even on very large screens
- It limits the size to which a container can grow (gives it a threshold wideness) in order not have text flowing all the way from one end of a large screen to the other, as this would make texts un-easy to read.

## Day 4

Day 4 had no challenge in it, but itself was a challenge

- Tried as much as I could to understand how the **_vh_**, **_vw_**, **_vmax_**, **_vmin_** works
- Learnt that they could be used to create a simple responsive header that will scale up or down with respect to the user's screen/viewport size

## Day 5

- It is not as easy to create a layout as it may seem before you get your hands on it
- No matter how simple a tutorial may seem, get your hands dirty and do something with it. Try to model the same thing or make use of the concept from the tutorial to model another thingâœŒ
- Today's 'Challenge03' was to create [this](https://www.figma.com/file/dGPcL6Ym2avOt4736aHb2B/conquer-responsive-layout-week-1-final-challenge?node-id=0%3A1). Explanation on how I went about it are posted as comments in the [last commit of the challenge](https://github.com/EmekaOrji/Conquering-Responsive-Layout/commit/8b178913a5a8abd91d83069200f6eb5a98470493)

Here is [my solution on codepen](https://codepen.io/emekaorji/pen/mdwbzpK)

## Day 6

- I understood that using em's for font-sizes multiple time may compound one upon another and make things get really frustrating to manage
- I would rather use rem's when setting the font-size of an element inside another element, as that would make it relative to the default font-size of the browser or that of the body element

## Day 7

- Didn't do much today
- Got the solution to "challenge03" and found better ways in which I would have made my css dry and easier to understand

## Day 8

- Intro to flexbox by Kevin Powell. And I tell you even though I already made use of flexbox previously, his approach is amazingly hassle free.
- Learnt a new way to add spaces in between objects with the 'selector1 + selector2' hack. (Implemented it into my challenge file, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/EmekaOrji/Conquering-Responsive-Layout/commit/ed0bd80d1f262da512fa9cafc3973ac721cdc6aa#r55538740))

Had a swell time solving the challenge of today!!
